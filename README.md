# _Jon's Second Webpage_

##### _Jon Nardine's first attempt at creating a 2-column layout, 9/18/2015_

#### By _**Jon Nardine**_

## Description

_This is Jon Nardine's second code review, which will test his ability to use div classes and other techniques to create a website that includes a header, a subheader, two columns beneath that, and a footer beneath those columns. One column will include headers and text while the other will include text and an unordered list of links._

## Setup

_Please visit this website:_

http://jwnardine.github.io/SecondReview

_Not sure what to put here at this point, mainly because accessing index.html seems like a simple procedure which does not involve numerous steps, and all I have to offer are index.html, the CSS modifier file secondstyle.css, and the README.md._

## Technologies Used

_HTML (Atom), CSS (Atom), Markdown, Github_
